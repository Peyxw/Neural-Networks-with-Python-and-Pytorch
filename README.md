Neural Networks with Python and Pytorch
# Setup
```pip install torch```<br>
```pip install torchvision ```
# What are neural networks? 
Artificial neural network computing is an advanced computing technology. It is targeted by the shape of the nerve of the simple pathway with ANN. In other words, it is the modeling of the synaptic link between being helped and benefiting from this success.
# What is Pytorch?
The Pytorch library, like the other deep learning libraries, really is just a library that does operations on tensors.
